PicGrid is a Pics Gallery Aplication in which each and every picture has a vote counting feature. This application uses Nodejs, Expressjs, Socket.io, MongoLabs etc. Application will be running on Amazon EC2 instance and the photos are stored in Amazon S3 bucket.


External Softwares or modules need to installed

I have used graphicsmagick for image processing and resizing.  

For EC2 instance, I have used CloudFront CDN that works with S3 bucket to ensure that the files are delivered properly with great speed and performance. 

For Windows user, install node.js on EC2 via Putty (TELNET CLIENT)


Appluication is running on http://13.58.72.197/
